        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello there! I'm currently a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill, on track to earn my B.S. in Computer Science in May 2026. With a Major GPA of 3.47, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation and solve complex problems. <br><br>

            One of my proudest achievements is co-founding Warmuth Capital LLC in June 2023, where I serve as a Senior Partner. Together with my friends, we successfully raised $25K in equity financing, established operational accounts, and developed comprehensive multi-year projections. Our focus on Capital Management and Real Estate Investment has been an exciting journey that has taught me invaluable skills in finance and strategic planning. <br><br>
            
            Beyond the world of coding and investments, I've recently ventured into the realm of web development. I've been honing my skills in HTML and CSS to create this very personal website. It's been a rewarding experience, allowing me to express my creativity and showcase my projects and passions. <br><br>
            
            When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you'll find me embracing an active lifestyle. I'm an easygoing and fun-loving individual who enjoys hitting the gym, skiing down the slopes of Boone, North Carolina, or exploring the great outdoors through hiking. Dedication is at the core of everything I do, and I bring that same commitment to both my personal and professional pursuits.<br><br>
            
            Join me on this exciting journey as I navigate the worlds of computer science, investment, and beyond. Thanks for stopping by!
